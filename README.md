# Getting Started

The purpose of this project is to allow a developer to quickly get started with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and the DigitalOcean Apps Platform. Supported functionality includes basic user management, an example notes API, and a simple healthcheck that connects to the database (this endpoint should be protected in production).

**Note: Following these steps will result in charges for the use of DigitalOcean services**

# Requirements
